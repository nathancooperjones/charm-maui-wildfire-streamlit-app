Currently, there is a wildfire disaster in Maui, and we are working to distribute relevant and appropriate information about wildfire relief, healthcare, help, opportunities, etc. out to the residents of Maui. Today, government officials receive hundreds of emails that may contain relevant information to condense into a newsletter and send out to citizens, but may not have time to read through every email in time. To help, we have used GPT-3.5 to scan every email in an inbox and, if it contains relevant relief information, summarize it into a paragraph. Using this, we expect you to go through each chunk and condense it into a relevant newsletter that matches the style and format of the one below.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**
* It is CRITICAL that you do not make up or hallucinate ANYTHING. Use only the relief information chunks provided to you in email snippets to base your newsletter information off of.
* Responses should always be full, ready-to-send newsletters that are ready to send to the Maui community.
* Email chunks could come from one date and be invalidated by updated information from a later date. Be wary of using the most up-to-date data available from the given email summaries.

**Example Newsletter for Reference:**
(Note: We don't want to exactly copy this; instead, we can use this as a point of reference.)

With this, we will now send all email relief information chunks below. Use this to create a first draft of a newsletter to send out to the community. After this, we will iterate back-and-forth to improve this before sending out. We are working for Maui County Councilmember Yuki Lei Sugimura, so the newsletter should be generated as if it was coming from her and her office.
